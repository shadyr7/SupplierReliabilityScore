    "\n",
    "3)Key Finding & Necessary Pivot: Upon loading and initial inspection, it was discovered that these selected files exclusively contained deposit (Supply) events. Crucially, data for borrows, repayments, or liquidations was not present in these files. This absence of borrowing-related data makes it impossible to assess creditworthiness or default risk in the traditional sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Revised Goal: Given this data limitation, the project pivoted to creating a \"Supplier Reliability Score\". This score (0-100) evaluates wallets based only on their behavior as suppliers of assets to the protocol. Higher scores reflect patterns indicative of stable, long-term, potentially human-driven supply activity. Lower scores reflect minimal engagement, very short-term activity, or patterns potentially associated with bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight with the data given the, \"Supplier Reliability Score\" is just \"Credit Score\" only for the particular dataset. I just used the \"Supplier Reliability Score\" because when evaluating ways on how to make this model, the key factors that make a credit score were not present in the dataset. I understood the assignment best to my capabilities and did what I think would closely align with the required objective and make the most meaning."
